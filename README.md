# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project - Week 4

This repo is the solution for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This repo contains: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. A README.md is included in the repo with the scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The following files are included:

1. CodeBook.md - describing how to use all the variables, the data and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

2. run_analysis.R - containing all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

3. tidydata.txt - the output of the 5th step, uploaded in the course project's form.
